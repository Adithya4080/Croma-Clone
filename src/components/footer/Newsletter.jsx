                    <p className='mt-3'>The first thing to consider while shopping for Accessories is their compatibility with the device you plan to use it with. Depending on the type and model of your gadget or appliance, the kind of Accessory it needs will vary. Another thing to keep in mind is the versatility of the Accessory. For example, a Smartphone Cover with a stand/finger holder makes it comfortable to use your phone for a longer duration. The brand of Accessories matters too as you can experience better connectivity and ease if your primary devices and accessories are of the same brand. Last but not the least, Accessories prices can range from a few hundred to thousands of rupees, depending on their features.</p>
